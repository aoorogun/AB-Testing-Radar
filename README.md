### README for A/B Testing Analysis

--

#### **Project Overview**
This repository contains an A/B testing analysis for one of the products in Prembly inc to evaluate the effectiveness of two variants (A and B) in achieving a desired outcome, such as increasing user engagement, conversions, or revenue. The analysis is structured to ensure statistical rigor and actionable insights.

---

#### **Files in the Repository**
1. **`ab_test_data.csv`**
   - Description: This file contains the dataset used for the A/B test analysis.
   - Format: CSV
   - Columns (expected):
     - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
     - `variant`: Indicates whether the user was exposed to variant A or B.
     - `conversion`: Binary indicator of whether the desired action was taken (1 for success, 0 for failure).
     - `timestamp`: (Optional) The time when the action occurred.
     - Any other relevant metrics or dimensions for segmentation.

2. **`ab_testing.ipynb`**
   - Description: A Jupyter Notebook containing the A/B testing analysis. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and interpretation of results.
   - Tools used:
     - Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and others.
     - Statistical methods: t-tests, chi-square tests, or other hypothesis testing techniques depending on the data structure.

#### **Analysis Workflow**
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the dataset and check for missing or inconsistent values.
   - Ensure data integrity by validating the test setup (e.g., even randomization).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize the distribution of conversions between variants.
   - Identify patterns or anomalies in the data.

3. **Statistical Testing**
   - Formulate null and alternative hypotheses:
     - Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): There is no significant difference in conversion rates between the variants.
     - Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): There is a significant difference in conversion rates.
   - Choose appropriate statistical tests based on data properties.
   - Evaluate p-values and confidence intervals to assess statistical significance.

4. **Results Interpretation**
   - Highlight whether the observed differences are statistically significant.
   - Discuss implications for business decisions.

5. **Conclusion**
   - Recommend next steps based on findings (e.g., deploy the better-performing variant, refine the test, or conduct further analysis).

#### **Usage Instructions**
1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install the necessary Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
     ```

2. **Run Analysis**
   - Open `ab_testing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

3. **View Results**
   - Inspect visualizations and statistical test outcomes in the notebook.
   - Refer to the conclusion section for actionable insights.

---

#### **Notes**
- Ensure the dataset is representative and large enough to achieve meaningful results.
- Randomization of users into variants is a critical assumption of the analysis.
- Address any potential biases or confounding variables before interpreting results.
